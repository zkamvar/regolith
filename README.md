# regolith

An R package for testing C functions. This allows me to take notes as I go along 
and not be burdened with the weight of a fully-featured package.

Why call it 'regolith?' Mainly because it's a [blanket term for loose rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith) 
that includes sand and the purpose of this package is basically a sandbox.
